# JaxApp

#### In honor of my sister, Jacqueline Thurber

## Background

My sister, Jacqueline (Jax) spent most of her life battling cancer. Recently, she lost that battle, fighting until the very end for both her life and independence. However, as the cancer spread, it slowly took away her ability to walk, talk, and perform daily activities without putting herself at risk.

Myself, along with the rest of my family, gathered together to provide her with whatever she needed to be comfortable. But with her extreme difficulty communicating, she was often unable to express what she wanted. At the time, I came up with a quick, easy solution: print a piece of paper with icons tied to her needs: a toilet, a cup of water, even a couch for when she just wanted company.

After she passed, I realized that I could expand this to accomidate both patients and caregivers. As a patient, you would be able to set up a simple, easy-to-understand home page of icons which, when tapped, would send a text message with a request to the caregiver if they were not immediately nearby. You would even be able to provide the urgency of the request by simply choosing between the green ("soon") or red ("now") buttons. With my background in nursing as well as my personal history with my sister, I felt confident that I would be able to create this app as a patient advocate.

This is an early draft of this idea, which I plan to expand further (see road map below).

## Road Map

The immediate next step will be to add the ability to register, log in and log out of the app. (Currently in development)

From there, I intend to pay particular attention to the new user experience, possibly asking for the things they have difficulty with and offering a list of common requests.

Recreate this app with React Native, integrating with AWS to provide notification services.

I would also like the ability for caregivers to have more advanced options, including medication reminders, and the ability to respond to "now" urgency requests to indicate acknowledgement.
